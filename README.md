The market for online dating has been growing fast in the past ten years, with an average industry growth of 13.3% a 
year from 2015 to 2020.1 A Pew survey in 2020 showed that 30% of US adults have used online dating services in their life.2 In this project, 
we will use data from an online dating application. We use a sample of 8000 individual ratings on this app. Each observation in our sample is 
characterized by a user who rated a profile shown to him/her by swiping right or left. For simplicity, we refer to the one who rates as the “user”.
and the one who is being rated as the “profile”. For each observation.
Data Visualization is done in Excel and Tableau
